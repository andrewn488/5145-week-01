# Overview and Hello

+ databases
+ objectives:

    + data types
        + Structured
        + NoSQL
        + Unstructured Big Data
    + DBMS
        + Collect and store data
        + index data to access it
        + protect the data
        + scalability
        + de-mystify the complexity of DBMS
    + Query Languages and Tools
        + T-SQL for SQL Server
        + MQL for MongoDB (unstructured)
        + Hadoop for unstructured data types
        + Power BI
    + Understand how data is stored and managed, and how to write queries to access that data


# What is Corporate Data

+ business related information used to help corporation be more successful and profitable
+ ignores data that adds no business / corporate value
+ transactional data - historically provided the most business value
+ changing data formats

    + semi-structured data (social media)
    + structured data
    + unstructured data
        + analyze big data and determine sentiment

+ new norm is no longer looking at transactional and structured data
+ must keep asking questions as an analyst
+ DATA ADVENTURERS!!!


# Course Logistics

+ Everything will be on canvas
+ 10 modules for the quarter. Each module will have: 

    + overview video
    + lecture videos
    + examples
    + "Take a break" - get your hands dirty
        + includes assignments to submit
        + provides information about how to knock out the weekly assignment
    + weekly assignment
    
+ SQL Queries for Mere Mortals - because it's awesome :) 

    + Focuses on data querying and manipulation <- what OMSBA is all about!
    
+ Mongo DB
+ Architecting Modern Data Platforms - hadoop

+ Grading

    1. weekly assignments
    2. Exams - midterm, final
    3. DTC

# Introductions

+ never underestimate the power of a strong network
+ start the journey by looking at the end requirements
+ know what the plant management system needed in order to run the plant
+ build the DBMS to bring it all together intelligently


# Database Systems

+ Database

    + Collections of data sets stored in a systematic way
    + document store
    + data warehouse
    + data mart
    
+ Data Lake

    + Require less up front management of the data
    + Open system that receives all kinds of native in their native format
        + unstructured
    + typically at high-velocity, from a variety of sources
    
+ Types of data

    1. Structured (Relational)
        + Rigid scheme-based, for rows and columns
        + Traditional business DBs
        + Known and maintained format
        + Products / sales / inventory / warehouse
        + DBMS required
            + Heavyweight, server-based systems
            + Controls all access and data integrity
            + Fast and scale upward
            + SQL Server / Oracle / MySQL / PostgreSQL
    2. Semi-structured (NoSQL <- "Not Only SQL")
        + non-relational and schema-less
        + Mobile and Web Applications
        + Seld-describing documents, graphs, and key-values
        + Facebook, OneNote, EverNote
        + DBMS not required
            + Lightweight, mobile
            + Works across platforms and devices
            + Places data logic and integrity on the application
            + JSON / MongoDB / Redis / Cassandra
            + Able to make changes to the data going forward, without making changes to historical data (due to semi-structured format)
    3. Unstructured (Big Data)
        + Unknown or changing structure
        + **All data has some kind of structure**, but we may not know it or control it or the structure varies
        + Can be pretty much any kind of data
        + **Sensor data** / social media posts / text/ binary
        + Sophisticated tools required
            + Hadoop / HBase / Google Big QUery / DynamoDB
            + often provide Data Lakes
            + heavy-weight tools that are scalable and high-speed
            + specially designed programming tools and skills
            

# Structured Database Concepts

+ Database Elements

    + Table <- collection of related data held in a DB
        + should NOT contain mixture of data
        + should ONLY contain related data
    + Row <- also called record, tuple, or data set
    + Field <- also called column, data values, or predictor
    
+ DB Designs

    + Database Schema <- blueprint of the tables and fields and relationships
    + Data Model <- higher level design
    + Relationship <- how fields between tables are linked
    + keys <- determine how the table is indexed and how things are related (how tables are linked together)
        + need some kind of key to link to other tables

+ Data Dictionary
    + Stores the description of tables in a database
    + And databases in an organization
    + AKA data catalog, metadata repository
    

# Database Management Roles

+ Oversight

    + CIO
        + interfaces with the board
        + responsible for ensuring all data is properly protected 
    + CTO
        + oversees grand plan of how everything fits together
        + People have access to all data schemas, models, integration
        + good place for analysts to get ingrained with
    + DB Architect aka Application Architect
        + understands every application within the company
        + the entire flow of data from origin to passing around to other parts of orgnaization
        + transaction data flows to other applications
        + architect must know where the data is created and where it ends up
        + manage things within the DB environment
    + Data Security Architect
        + manage data privacy issues
        + what's accessed, who access it, and how is it accessed
        + ensure data is properly controlled

+ Daily Hands on

        + person responsible for 1 or more DB's of a particular product type
        + ensure DB runs properly
        + ensure the right people have the right access to products
        + ensures DB is backed up and safe
    + DB Security Administrator
        + similar to security architect
        + grants rights to data
    + DB Designer / Developer
        + not concerned with daily upkeep of DB

# Database Review - Assignment

+ Database <- collection of data sets stored in a systematic way
+ Data types: structured / semi-structured / unstructured (idk what the structure is or can't control it)
+ Structured data

    + schema-based, relational DBs
    + traditional business DBs
    + known and maintained format
    + products / sales / inventory / warehouse
    + DBMS required
        + heavyweight, server-based systems
        + controls all access and data integrity
        + fast and scale upward
        
+ DB Elements

    + table <- collection of related data held in a DB
    + row <- aka record, tubple, data set
    + field <- column, data values, or predictor
        + types of data
    + schema
    
+ DB example: manages sales and returns

    + can't change DB much once it's put in place
    
+ Updating Frequency

    + Database
        + Batch Processing <- collects all transactions for a time period, then processes the data and updates the data store.
            + ran at some set recurrence (eg. "every 24 hours) 
        + OLTP <- Online-Transaction-Processing - processes each transaction as it occurs (real-time)
            + does not mean "cloud"
